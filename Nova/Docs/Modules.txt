Modules are extra pieces of code that can expand the capabilities of Nova. Nova comes bundled with the GetDateTime module and the Weather module.

Adding a module:
1. Develop the module. This involves just writing the code for whatever the module should do.
2. Add the file in \Nova\Modules and add a reference to the ModuleAPI script to your module
3. Add the "Initialize" method to your script. This will be called once when the module is added to the project and then never again. It must contain the following calls to the ModuleAPI:
-InstallModule(string filename, string methodName (which method should be called when running the module), string description (explain your module to ChatGPT), json parameters (the parameters your method needs. Leave empty if none)) This is required for the module to be used
In the Initialize method add all code that needs to run once to set up your module
4. Go to Nova\Configs\ModuleList.json and add a new entry like so:
"NameOfThemEthodThatShouldBeCalled": "NameOfTheFile"

Your module should now be displayed as "loaded" when you boot up Nova.
