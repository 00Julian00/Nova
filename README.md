All needed information for installing is in Nova\Docs

This is an open source AI personal assistant, based on the OpenAI API, originally started as a proof of concept, became a highly expandable platform for a personal assistant that can do basicly anything, as long as you can code it. Instructions on how to add functionality are in Nova\Docs\Modules.txt. Note that this project is in alpha and custom modules are not
yet fully implemented, but you can add and run them nevertheless. Nova also uses googles Speech-To-Text for hotword detection and Elevenlabs as a Text-To-Speech. You need an OpenAI API key and an Elevenlabs API key to run this.
